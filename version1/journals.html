                    <p>Ebony is a strange child. </p>
                    <p>I wrote to Sam two days after she arrived, to tell him that everything was fine, and not to worry. And to inquire gently why Ebony had been sent here alone. </p>
                    <p>What I wanted to ask – the question that dripped off the end of my pen, real as ink, was; <span style="font-weight: 1000;">what is wrong with her?</span></p>
                    <p>She talks of nothing but her sister. She seems obsessed with her to the point that I can scarcely get a word in. She is better than her sister in every way, she says. She is smarter, taller, and stronger. She plays a better game of chess. She runs faster. She has more friends. </p>
                    <p>It seems her sister only exists to prove her own superiority. </p>
                    <p> At first, she seemed sad to be here alone. She barely spoke at all, and when she did, she talked about her family, and what they might be eating for dinner. What they might be watching on television, of the conversations she must be missing. But now she seems pleased to be the centre of attention. </p>
                    <p>Ebony doesn’t like to be interrupted. If I try to speak when she is speaking, if I disturb her in the midst of her long monologues, she speaks louder and louder until I am drowned out. </p>
                    <p>I wonder why Henry and Fiona sent her here by herself. I wonder if they were hoping I would beat some sense into the girl. </p>
                    <p>I found her in the garden last night. 	She was crouched in the overgrown grass with a headlamp fixed to her forehead like a glowing yellow eye. </p>
                    <p>She heard me coming, and she turned to me. Her tongue was pinned between her teeth with concentration. </p>
                    <p>‘Ebony, what are you doing?’</p>
                    <p>She had picked apart a lizard. Its tiny legs and arms wriggled beside its snake-like body. </p>
                    <p>She grinned. ‘Now he can’t get away.’</p>
                    <p>I lie awake wondering if she is out there, tearing apart rats. </p>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: 1000;">What is wrong with that girl?</span></p>
